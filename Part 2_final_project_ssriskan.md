### **Wireframe**


Based on feedback from what I got from class, this is the intial wireframe I have and the story progression I wanted to share.

**insert story**

What is different was from before was that I included the death count based on race as well. In order to explain why the death count was high, I added an additional table about pre-existing conditions to justify it. I assumed that it had to be very short in order to present it in class, but I realized that having this information paints a better picture of what is going on and important for the story telling. I also am trying to incorporate more infographics so it is more visually appealing. 


### **User research**


The purpose of this was to inform the public. I think while the general public (those in and out of New York City) could benefit from being aware. The people who are likely to take actions are the following groups:

**Local residents**: Bringing awareness to your neighborhood can allow them to take direct actions. 

**Local and state politicians**: Visuals can help advocate for their causes and aiding in community outreach. Also helps with raising awareness of the issue and how it is affecting the city (which is a main source of financial income to the state)


### **Interviews**


I tried to interview one person who would repersent the general public and not from New York City, one person who has a background in healthcare but also not from New York City, and someone who is from New York City and has a knowledge of healthcare. I specifically picked out those people because I wanted to try to get a variety of different audiences. Though my audience is primarily targetted at New York City, I wanted to gauge to see if a complete outsider could understand what is happening clearly. 

The questions I asked were the following:

*1. Did you know this information before reading it?*

*2. What problem do you think the visualizations are trying to tell you?*

*3. Who do you think this is targeted for?* 

*4. What is the proposed solution for this problem?*

*5. What did you find confusing? What would you change?*

*6. Based on what you have seen, do you feel compelled to take action? Why or why not?*

*7. Do you have additional questions after looking at it?*

*8. What would you have done differently?*

| Questions | Person 1 (Non-NY, young 20s, represents general public)| Person 2 (Non-NY, young 20s, has a background in healthcare)| Person 3 (NYC Native, upcoming med student)| Changes I should make|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Did you know this information before reading it? | He noted that he use to live in New York City a few years, but is originally from Pennsylvania. Therefore, his concern is primarly on what is going on in Pennsylvania. "I knew it was a problem but I didn't know the statistics" | "I never really thought that it was that big of a problem until I saw it"| "Yes like every single piece of information." He is involved in community outreach in Queens and has been attending training sessions about this so none of this is new| N/A|
| What problem do you think the visualizations are trying to tell you? | He realized that there is a staggering amount of COVID cases in New York City and he thought the purpose of this was to show where it is happening and why that is the case | She was able to quickly undestand what the visualizations were trying to tell her. "The problem of racial disparities in terms of COVID impact"| "I feel so dumb to just say it. COVID-19 disproportionally affecting people of color in marginal communities, particularly in New York City"| I should think of a way to state more clearly that the racial disaprities are making the situation worse. I think people generally realize that race plays a role but maybe stating it more clearly can help with the narrative|
| Who do you think this is targeted for? | 1) The General Population so they are informed with what is going on. 2) State and local politicians as it is possibly useful to start dicussions and visualize what is happening. 3) Hospitals as there is a focus on hospitalizations | She wasn't entirely sure. There was a pause before she said "people who want to access the health of neighborhoods?"| "I don't think there is no specific target"| N/A - This was originally intended to be more informative. I didn't think about hospitals being interested in this so that is a new audience to know and try to consider when building the final recommendations so it's clear|
| What is the proposed solution for this problem? | Proposed solutions is to call your representative and community outreach | She remembered it and said to call representatives and community outreach| Join NYS Service and call local representatives| Make the recommendations more flashy so it's obvious what it is. They primarily remembered to call your representatives one but not the volunteer one right away| 
| What did you find confusing? What would you change? | None. He found it useful and very clear. In the solution thogh, he suggested that he would break it up depending on who your target audience is (i.e what should the general public do, what should politicians do, what should hospitals do) since it affects all of them | She found some of the graphs a little confusion that showed the %. She thinks I should add more descriptive titles and captains. She also found the graph about the likelihood of owning a car random and didn't understand the reason it was in there. | He commented that having a consistent color se would make it nicer. He suggested adding links to local representatives because if he sees to just call your local representative, then he would not care much. Providing a link can help make that action more likely |I will be making the titles and captions more clear. After talking to Person 2, I may try to incorporate more infographs and limit the bar charts when possible. I will also rearrange the slides so the vehicle comes at the end of Part 1 and some context of why it's there.|
| Based on what you have seen, do you feel compelled to take action? Why or why not? | No because he is not particulary involved in community outreach and not from New York City. He did mention though that it made him more aware of what is happening | "Yes because there is an obvious disaprity between people, and they need justice"| Because he is already involved, he said he wouldn't because he is currently taking action. However, he said "coming from a perspective just for taking information, it makes sense." | N/A|
| Do you have additional questions after looking at it? | The concept is pretty simple and easy to understnad. "I'm the general public. I'm useless" | Nothing| "No. It's pretty comprehensive"| N/A- seems like everyone is getting the point|
| What would you have done differently? | He reinterated about breaking down the solutions | She didn't think besides what she mentioned she would've changed anything| He recommends adding more information on the slide of "why this might be the case?" in Part 2 | I will breakdown the solutions based on the target audience so the recommendations are appropiate to whoever is reading it. Per Person's 3 recommendation, I will add more information to it because it's dangerous to assume everyone knows what I am thinking. | 

Common themes: I think for the most part, there is little confusion, which hopefully means that there is a clear story and there is a clear call to action. This could be credited to discussing my initial Part 1 with peers from the class, which asked additional questions that I was able to include. From Part 1 to Part 2, I also included information about the deaths and why the number of deaths were coming up. I also included information about the fact that non-whites are more likely to have pre-existing conditions due to their surroundings in order to further explain why they are more likely to die from COVID-19. 

Something I asked a couple of people was how to make it more engaging? I was worried that there is too many bar graphs and was brainstorming other ways to switch it up. For example, for the story about "Some races are more affected than others" has bar graphs, but I was thinking if there is another way to visualize that. After speaking to the interviewees, I may switch it into shaded bars so it can be better seen that it is a proportion of people because I was asked about that. Something I will definitely consider is to break up the solutions more clearly and make it specific depending to the audience I am going to communicate to. It didn't occur to me that it will have multiple audiences and should be addressed accordingly so I will definitely do that. I also noticed my color choices are a little out there and not consistent so based on themoodboard I create, I will be using those colors to keep the theme consistent. 

Based off the feedback in and out of class, these are the direct changes I will make to the wireframe:

1. Change the bar graph to the slide "Some races are more affected than others." I will be making the bar graph horizontal and actually show the proportion. I think that will visually be easier for people see and compare the proportions to one another
2. Move the vechile slide at the end of Part 1 and keep the "health stuff" together. 
3. Add more information on the infograph that the viewer would be able to see
4. Breakdown the solutions based on who is the target audience. 
5. Will change the title of the presentation. The title was suppose to be based of Charles Dickens' novel "A Tale of 2 Cities" but an international student in my group didn't know the refernece so he assumed I was about to present a comparison between 2 cities. 


### Moodboard

I created a moodboard to help establish a color palatte and an overall theme. I noticed my color choices were a little over the place so I thought creating a moodboard can help me with that.
