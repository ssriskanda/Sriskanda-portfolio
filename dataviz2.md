# Part 2: Working with Flourish

This shows the Debt-to-GDP ratio from an assortment of countries from 1995-present day.

For the third chart, I thought it would be interested to see how the GDP-to-Debt ratio was impacted by many countries during the global financial crisis in 2008. I used a grid of column charts to illustrate this point because I thought it would be easier for the viewer to see the side by side comparision of how it changes (which is easier on the eye compared to a line graph as we did earlier). I expanded each graph so it's easier to see the bars and compare while also putting the actual numbers on top since some countries showed little difference. Instead of having the countries from 1995-present day, I thought it would be better to keep it within 2005-2010 so it's solely in the area we focused. I kept the colors gray since there is not that particularly needs to be emphasized and keeping it color neutral makes it accessible for all viewers.
