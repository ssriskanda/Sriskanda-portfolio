# Part 2: Working with Flourish

This shows the Debt-to-GDP ratio from an assortment of countries from 1995-present day.

For the third chart, I thought it would be interested to see how the GDP-to-Debt ratio was impacted by many countries during the global financial crisis in 2008. I used a grid of column charts to illustrate this point because I thought it would be easier for the viewer to see the side by side comparision of how it changes (which is easier on the eye compared to a line graph as we did earlier). I expanded each graph so it's easier to see the bars and compare while also putting the actual numbers on top since some countries showed little difference. This was the easiest way to visualize it compared to the other options Instead of having the countries from 1995-present day, I thought it would be better to keep it within 2005-2010 so it's solely in the area we focused. I kept the colors gray since there is not that particularly needs to be emphasized and keeping it color neutral makes it accessible for all viewers. 

Something that can be observed in all of the countries is that the ratio all increased after 2008 by quite amount. It is the most noteable in the United States (which makes sense as the housing bubble took place in the US). What was interesting to see that Western Countries such as the UK, France, and Canada seem to have a higher debt ratio after 2008 in comparison to some countries like Mexico. Something that would be interesting to see in the future is to group the countries based on a nation's development, which was a feat I was not able to accomplish using flourish. 

This differs from the second visual with the line graph because it is trying to show different things. The line graph seems to be good for noting overall trends in the past few decades. The grid of column charts to show a specific time frame can be used to show a dramatic change after a specific event (in this case the financial crisis). It is easer to note the change and being able to compare it to other countries. This can be seen as the numbers are placed above the bar so the reader is able to approixamate the difference themselves without looking at the y-axis.
