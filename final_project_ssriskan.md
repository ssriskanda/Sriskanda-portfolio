# How COVID is worsening health disparities in New York City

New York City was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, resulting in the entire region expereiecing a lot of trauma. Even though the COVID situation in NYC is much more manageable, there are still some issues in some neighorbhoods that are affecting certain races due to the pandemic.

(Note: I originally wanted to do food scarcity in New York City but I decided to expand to health disaprities since it all ties in together and there was more to show)

# Call to Action

The purpose of this story is to share what has been going on and who is currently at risk. That way, I can provide recommendations and share resources in order to donate food/money, take action, call a representative, and/or just be knowledgeable. 


# Data

**COVID DATA**

Datasource 1: John Hopkins University github
Link: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

Datasource 2: COVID tracking project 
Link: https://covidtracking.com/

Datasource 3: Data USA
Link: https://datausa.io/profile/geo/new-york-ny#:~:text=The%205%20largest%20ethnic%20groups,and%2084.3%25%20are%20U.S.%20citizens.


I chose these three datasets because they are all data collected from the pandemic. Data source 1 and 2 are primary souce data that is being used for most of the visualizations in the US so I think they are reliable. Datasource 3 also contains COVID data that comes from Datasource 2 but also comes in pre-aggregated form that could be easier for the analysis. 

This is a data that measures food insecurity at the tract level. I picked these three because I think that this can be used to show how bad the pandemic got and in real time. I intend on using this data to map out how badly the pandemic is spreading across New York City. I think I might need multiple datasets because sometimes I might need a combination of information so I can merge them on Python/R. This would be the data that I can use to measure how severe it is. I imagine the data being used in 2 ways:

1. A graph of some sort to show how COVID cases are changing over time (i.e a bar graph)
2. A heat map to see where neighborhoods are getting more cases than others. Ideally this would be broken down based on neighborhood

**HEALTH DISAPARITY DATA**

Datasource 1: US Census Food Insecurity 
Link: https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-supp_cps-repwgt/cps-food-security.html

Datasource 2: NYC Gov
Link: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page

This is a data that measures food insecurity at the tract elvel. Can be used to better visualize the specific boroughs/areas that are experiecing health disaprities (i.e food insecurity, vaccine distribution, health hospitalization, etc..).
