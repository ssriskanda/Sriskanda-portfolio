### **Final changes and reflection**


The general skeleton of the presentation was based off the wireframe I did in [Part 2](https://ssriskanda.github.io/Sriskanda-portfolio/Part%202_final_project_ssriskan.html) of the final project. I did bump into some issues along the way as the way I wanted to format it was not always compatible with Shorthand, so I had to get creative in order to place it where I wanted to. In addition, the data was not always formatted in a way that could be used easily in Flourish. There were several datasets that I had to do some data rearranging in Python in order to render it in the format that I would like to (which sometimes requires me to find a completely different data source in order to format it appropiately). I first build out the visualizations before adding text around it in order to make sure that I had what I wanted first before I type it out the text. Something looking back was that I should've expeirmented with Shorthand before building my wireframe. When I was drawing out my wireframe, I made assumptions about how the images would render and their final position. This caused a lot of issues when I was actually using Shorthand since it was not formatted in the way I anticipated and had to make more designing decisions. 

The final changes I made where the following:

1. I removed the Part 1 and Part 2 slides that I had in my wireframe and replaced them with some more text. I thought I needed it, but when I was building the final presentation, I realized that I didn't. Without it, there is still a story to tell so it felt uncessary and disrupted the flow for me. 

2. I removed the the transportation graph from my storytelling. It was something that was in debate with those who I interviewed with. They didn't understand why that graph was there and suggested putting it somewhere else in the story. When I tried to take their suggestions, I realized that it was still hindering the storyline so I removed it. No matter where I put it, it always seemed to be stick out rather than flow like the other visualizations. 

3. If there is a chance to make the graphs interactive, I made an attempt to do so in Flourish. I only intended for one graph to be interactive (the bubble graph that breaks down race demographics in NYC neighborhoods), but I ended up doing the second for the bar graph about pre-existing conditions. The bar graphs for pre-existing conditions were intended to be a list of bar graphs that can be seen by scrolling. While I was in flourish, I realized I could make the different diseases a drop down option so the user can choose which disease to look at. I personally found it better to visualize, more interactive for the user, and easier on the flow of the story. While the graphs were not exactly what I anticipated, I was still happy with the results. 

4. I added an additional info graph to show the proportion of frontline workers are people of color. While I was building my vaccination info graph, I was thinking to myself "why is this a problem." This was something I tried to emphasize in that part but adding that a majority of frontline workers are not white for me helped me make that point. I also added more to the 

5. Per my interviewees' recommendation, I added more "call to actions" depending on who could be potentially viewing it. My original intention at Part 1 was to just have it as a tool for the general public. After hearing how other parties could be using it, I tried to tailor it accordingly by adding multiple options.

6. I also adjusted my color scheme again. I created a mood board but I found it hard to stick to a particular color scheme. I kept within general color schemes but I found myself at the end being more flexible about what colors I used (especially when it comes to the info graphs I made). The interviewees' are all within my close circle, so I was frequently asking for their opinion and to look. Even though it didn't stick to a "strict" color scheme, they found it use friendly and didn’t hinder from the overall story.

Overall, this was a challenge for myself and I am proud with the product I am left with.
