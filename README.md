Portfolio for visualizations for Telling Stories with Data 

# About me

I am currently a second year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Public Policy and Management- Data Analytics Track. I recently graduated from New York University on May 2019, obtaining a double degree in Public Health and Biology. While at NYU, I realized the importance of data and how much data out there that needs to be handled, which encouraged me to go straight into graduate school. Despite being in school, I have completed a variety of internships in non-profit, start-up labs, government, and the profit sector. Currently, I am interested in using analytics to better serve the public and address pressing issues facing us today.

# What I hope to learn

I mainly wanted to work on building high quality visualizations. Visualizations for data in public health is important not only within the organization but also when doing interventions for the public. Being able to build strong visualizations is very powerful and can tell more than words could even explain, and that is something I wanted to improve on. Through this class, I hope to address different aspects of visualizing data and explore parts of it that I have never heard of before. Additionally (as a smaller goal), I hope to utilize my GitHub account more. I realize it's something that is becoming more used, and I don't really get many chances to use it and want to have a chance to use it during my course. I personally find GitHub a little intimidating to use and it's something I wanted to get use to using.
