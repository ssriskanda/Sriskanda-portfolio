# About Me

I am currently a second year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Public Policy and Management- Data Analytics Track. I recently graduated from New York University on May 2019, obtaining a double degree in Public Health and Biology. While at NYU, I realized the importance of data and how much data out there that needs to be handled, which encouraged me to go straight into graduate school. Despite being in school, I have completed a variety of internships in non-profit, start-up labs, government, and the profit sector. Currently, I am interested in using analytics to better serve the public and address pressing issues facing us today.
